# Steps to create latex based resume

1. I have used Jake Ryan overleaf template. So login to https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs website.
2. Remove all the existing content of this template with the uploaded .tex extension file.
3. Re-compile the content that you replaced with .tex file on overleaf website.
4. Whoa! You got resume just like mine. Now update as per your choice.
